# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a simple create-update-delete inventory management system.

### Setup

calling 
```
npm install
```
is all you need to do. Hopefully.

### Running

You need to run this in a web server of some kind to get the right headers
to allow the CORS actions to succeed. Using the vscode live server plugin
is sufficient to do this.
